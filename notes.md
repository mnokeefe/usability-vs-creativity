## Story
“Usability kills creativity”

Form follows function / form over function / form vs function

*creativity*
/ˌkriːeɪˈtɪvɪti/
noun
the use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness.

*usable*
/ˈjuːzəb(ə)l/
adjective
able or fit to be used.

Create something:
* Imaginative
* Original
* Inventive
* Usable

## Problem
Familiar is usable...
...familiar is boring

Different is creative...
...different is harder to use

In advertising, standing out is what makes the difference. In an interface, doing something different is what makes something unusable.

### How do we avoid generic design?

So often the design starts with a grid, logo top left, main nav - that should be the last resort.

Google used as an example for simple design, but google isn't a destination, it's a method of travel

iPod spinner?

UX gets users involved, but people can only give you feedback based on what they know - show sketches from workshops?

## Proposition

Understand the purpose of the product
    - User journey
    - Understand what's important

Understand what makes something usable
    - Car design: Steering wheel and controls stay the same
    - Book: Contents at the front, content in the middle, index at the end

Experiment with everything else

Obvious always wins - show things, don't hide them

Group similar tasks - edit, navigate etc.

Experiment - go too far, multiple versions, do the obvious one and throw it away

Test concepts with users, don't ask them to fix it, just see if they can use it:
“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” - Not actually Henry Ford

## Proof
Usability is in the detail, usability is in the journey

Subjective vs objective


## Conclusion
Don't mess with what works, mess with the rest
